# Pathplanning Workshop

Path Planning is a crucial part of robotics and automation that enables robots to navigate their environments safely and efficiently. In this workshop, we will provide an introduction to Path Planning and teach the fundamentals of implementing path planning algorithms in Python. You don't need to have any prior knowledge coming into this workshop, as it is aimed towards students who are completely new to the process. By the end, you should be familiar with the basic concepts of path planning and be able to implement basic path planning algorithms using Python. We will cover topics such as:

- Graph/Node theory
- Basic graph search algorithms:
  - Breadth First Search 
  - Depth First Search 
  - Djikstra
  - UCS 
  - A* (A Star)

If possible we will also show some implementations of these algorithms in robotics applications. 

This workshop was developed in collaboration with [UQCS](https://github.com/UQComputingSociety).


# Resources
- We will be using a pre-existing repository written by Guroosh Singh (Github ID: guroosh) for implementation and visualisation of DFS and A*. 

    Clone/Download the repository from here: https://github.com/guroosh/CS7IS2-AI-project.git

- Slides will be uploaded in the future.
